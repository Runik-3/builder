==Biography==
Ferdy the Fence is a market trader who sometimes works at the Fairy market. He is a tough negotiator. In a deal with [[Captain Shakespeare]], they argue about the price of a lightning bolt. But [[Captain Shakespeare]] wins. He's also friends with [[Ditchwater Sal]] and has interest in the fallen star, who is [[Yvaine]]. Unknown to Ferdy, she is in that very room at the moment.

==Death==
[[Lamia]] finds him in his office and asks him where [[Yvaine]] went. Then she asks him what the chances of finding a [[Babylon candle]] are, but he annoys her when he says that it's a small chance she will find one and then he starts talking about another subject. She then hexes his voice so when he talks he only utters strange chickens sounds. She then leaves and takes a yarn wig with her. [[Septimus]] and his men later encounter him. But [[Septimus]] taking the chicken sounds as mockery stabs him.

==Trivia==
*Note that he did not exist in the book. He was a new character introduced in the movie.
*The fact he works in an office is reference and a joke to the fact Ricky Gervais played the main character in British comedy show "The Office". He also produced the American version of the show.
